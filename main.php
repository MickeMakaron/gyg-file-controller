/*
 * The File controller creates a good-looking linking structure for files.
 * If you want to link to a file, simply link to it using gyg's createImgUrl function. 
 * The visible link will have the format "fileController/controller/filePath" if in the
 * controller's directory, and "fileController/controller/page/filePath" if
 * in the page's directory. 
 *
 * The page argument is interpreted as the controller containing the file.
 * Furthermore, at least 1 argument is required. The minimum is thus this:
 * 		controller/filePath.
 *
 * If the file is under a specific page, however, it is possible to 
 * create a path relative to the page's directory, instead of the
 * controller's directory:
 *		controller/page/filePath. 
 * thus there is one page argument and two arguments.
 *
 * If the argument list size is 1, it will be interpreted as the
 * file's path relative to the controller's directory.
 *
 * If the argument list size is 2 or greater, the first argument
 * will be interpreted as the page ID, and the remaining arguments
 * will be interpreted as the file's path relative to the page's 
 * directory.
